        <p>
          You might see me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But
          nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and
          mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
          Development Hero.

            needed to make a website function, and efficient. I didn't stop with
            the web. I went beyond with the most popular Javascript framework
            called Vue JS. I even know the deployment, server, and security. I
            will give you a 100% web solution.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself a remove web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
